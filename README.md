# ML_Project12-FraudDetection

### Payment Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression
This project tackles the crucial task of detecting fraudulent transactions within a payment system using machine learning. Here, we employ Logistic Regression to classify transactions as either legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1) based on historical data.

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

The project utilizes the payment_fraud.csv dataset containing information about payment transactions. Pandas is used to load and explore the data. Key steps include:
```
Data Cleaning: Confirming no missing values are present.
Exploratory Analysis:
Visualizing the distribution of payment methods using Seaborn's barplot.
Identifying the class imbalance (more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones).
Applying label encoding to the paymentMethod column.
Generating a correlation heatmap to explore feature relationships.
Calculating descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
```

### Feature Selection and Preprocessing:

In this example, all features (excluding the target label) are considered for model training. Feature selection techniques can be explored further for potential improvements.

StandardScaler is used to standardize the features, ensuring all features contribute equally during model training.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to train the model on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

A Logistic Regression model is created and trained on the scaled training features and labels.

Predictions are made on the testing set using the trained model.

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics:

Accuracy: Overall percentage of correct predictions.

Classification Report: Provides detailed information about precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (legitimate and fraudulent transactions). This is crucial due to the class imbalance.

Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.


### Results and Discussion:

The Logistic Regression model achieves a high accuracy on the testing set, indicating its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

However, the classification report reveals limitations due to the class imbalance. The model excels at identifying legitimate transactions but struggles with fraud detection due to the scarcity of fraudulent cases in the dataset.


### Further Exploration:

Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) can address class imbalance and improve fraud detection accuracy.

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for potentially better performance.

Utilize cost-sensitive learning to assign higher weights to misclassifying fraudulent transactions.

Consider incorporating additional features relevant to fraud detection (e.g., transaction amount, location, device information).
Implement real-time fraud detection systems that can analyze transactions as they occur.


### Disclaimer:

This is a basic example, and the effectiveness of fraud detection models can vary depending on the specific data and chosen techniques. It's crucial to continuously monitor and improve such models to maintain their efficacy.
